# Working with WordPress at UCLA

In this demo presentation, we’ll go through the steps to build a people directory on an academic site. We’ll see how Advanced Custom Fields, WordPress custom post types, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Multi-column layouts are combined in a real-world example. We’ll take a look at WordPress admin screens, functions.php, front end templating and semantic HTML to develop a solution in production today.
